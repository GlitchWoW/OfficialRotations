PvP talents: 
- Burrow, Shamanism, Unleash Shield

Stat prio: 
- Vers > Haste > Mastery > Crit
- Use mastery for off-pieces, otherwise full haste

Initiate combat with flame shock and watch it go!

Lava wolf mode:
- Will attempt to use ghost wolf as much as possible and only exit to cast 
spells, its designed in a way to allow you to still move around while 
upkeeping your debuffs and still pumping damage and will fallback to 
ghost form.

NOTES:
- Remember to bind your pet attack key (One of your F keys will do)
- Remember to bind your "Pet Action Button 6" - I just use an F key. (F10)
- Set your precast time to around 80-100
- LOS unit timeout: ~1000
- Set your racial settings in rotation 'Configurations'
- For trinket, either insignia(for damage) or emblem(for another defensive)
- Have your self cast key bound to 'auto'.
