In raid, for more small add fights you should turn off Rupture (Gnarl/Igura).
Personally, I turn off Defensives as well, we are fairly proactive and will Feint Mechanics.
This uses energy, small DPS loss. Just go in with Major CDs and Minor CDs on. TTD to zero. 
Utilize Lorrgs to assist in timers for big CDs and when to Hold them.
There is a Short CD button, that means if the fight is going to be short < 2.5min
toggle that for higher DPS. Turn off Redirect as well.
